# Compact_Radio_Telescope_code
This project is about the testing, rotator control, and data processing of the compact radio telescope project at Northeastern University (Boston). It is also part of my master's thesis project.

This project mainly includes three parts: 

1. Rotator control and SDR data recording. PyMd01 is a GUI program. And observation is used for out campus observation, no gui.

2. Data processing. 

3. Radio interferometer array simulation.
